Description may be empty.\r\n* Trims search terms.\r\n* Santises all user input (but does not restrict length).\r\n* The implementation sometimes uses $item (resp., $category) as an object\r\n* and sometimes as the id of that object.  Be careful.\r\n* Although the specification does not require this, the interface would be\r\n* improved if there were a navigation element to search for items and add\r\n* a new item on every page.\r\n* This is all the documentation there is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
