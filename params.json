{"name":"AUSBAY","tagline":"WELCOME TO MY OPEN SOURCE PROJECT PAGE!!!","body":"**Objective:**\r\n> AusBay.com is free  bidding web site .\r\n> It works same as ebay. \r\n> The aim of this simple website to add items for bid or sale or buy item from there.\r\n> I'm going to Open Source all of my code for free to use .\r\n> You can download it for free .\r\n> Comment on my gist link.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**How AusBay work?**\r\n* Modified specification to put \"add new item\" form on home page to fill page\r\n* and avoid an unnecessary link.\r\n* Extended specification to make category a link on \"item details\" page.\r\n* After deleting an item, displays list of items in category of deleted item.\r\n* Validates that item name, category, vendor and price are nonempty,\r\n* and that price is a positive number.  Description may be empty.\r\n* Trims search terms.\r\n* Santises all user input (but does not restrict length).\r\n* The implementation sometimes uses $item (resp., $category) as an object\r\n* and sometimes as the id of that object.  Be careful.\r\n* Although the specification does not require this, the interface would be\r\n* improved if there were a navigation element to search for items and add\r\n* a new item on every page.\r\n* This is all the documentation there is.\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\n\r\n* FOR AUS BAY PROJECT CODE GO HERE => https://gist.github.com/mawais\r\n\r\n* FOR FURTHER QUERY GO HERE => \r\n* GMAIL / FACEBOOK / LINKEDIN / TWEETER : innovativetechnologezau@gmail.com\r\n\r\n* ALTERNATIVE : src.awais@gmail.com\r\n \r\n* > You can download it from my gist link or request me by email.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
