Ausbay.com is web site like ebay.
It works same as ebay.
Upload items for bid or sale now.
It compare the bidding price and store for starting to ending time for bidding items.
I used php for major scripts , css3,html,smarty for templates.Js for security. Mysql for data bases.
Each item has bidding time after the will expir it will be automatically remove from item list.
You can bid item ,and owner of the item can change item price modify , add or delete item from list of items.
You can search item by catagories, by item name etc.
The main aim for this project open sourcing to improve coding and it is free to use it .
